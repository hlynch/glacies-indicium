Rasterio Linux wheels are built on CentOS, which stores SSL certificates
in ``/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt``. On other Linux flavors,
certificates may be stored in a different location. On Ubuntu, you can
e.g.Â run

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

to fix this issue. For more information, see
