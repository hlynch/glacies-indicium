## This folder is to test my class diagrams for the software design doc

# currently the scripts.js appends a static text list of all the regions within Antarctica, and can contain any amount of nested subregions

## Run the file

# open index.html in the browser to view the list

## Edit the list

# add a new json object with a name field, and subregions if necessary
